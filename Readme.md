This app converts the frequencies for specified EDO notes-per-octave to MIDI 2.0 Pitch/Fractional pitch. 

See https://www.midi.org/specifications/midi-2-0-specifications/midi2-core for more details. 
The relevant info is in M2-104-UM_v1-0_UMP_and_MIDI_2-0_Protocol_Specification
Section 4.2.14.3 MIDI2.0NoteOnWithAttribute#3Pitch7.9

As of yet these values have not been tested for accuracy. 

## TODO
- Test on something besides Mac Designed for iPad
- UI is ugly
- Want to export as JSON
- Hard to find result file (save file panel for MacOS)
